    As is illustrated in the above two pictures, a person is thinking that he has the possesion of so many books in the bookshelf. However,  he is not reading one of the books but   compfortablely lying in the chair. While in the other picrute we are seeing another person having few books  concentrates on reading a book. The same phenomenon also often appears in our lives which should be concerned much.
    With the rapid development of information technology and the large number of temptation that distracts us, we are becoming so impetuous that we even are not able to read  books wholeheartedly, which is extremely ridiculous and detrimental,  bringing about some bad influences  to both humans and  the society. As a positive habit, reading books brings us knowledge , arouse us our enthusiasm for future life and help us to enhance our quality. Unfortunately,  people usually think that they have books so they have known the knowledge in books, which is apparently wrong at all.  Such a widespread phenomenon can undoubtedly endanger us and the society.
    As a college student,  I am convinced that people should realize  that having books doesn't mean having knowledge . Meanwhile, the society are supposed to forge a wholesome atmosphere to advocate and encourage people not only to buy books but to be absorbed in reading books. Therefore, few books even if we have, we are supposed to try reading books as many as we can . Only when we absorb knowledge into our brains will it be really helping us.
